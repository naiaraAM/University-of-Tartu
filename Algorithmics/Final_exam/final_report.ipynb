    "Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors at 90° have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude.\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "For this exercise I tried two different approaches, using cosine similarity and using hash function. I will explain both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity consumes too much time, so I used a \"pre-processing\" step to make the code run faster. What it does at first is, block by block of ``n`` vertical lines, it hashes the block, and then, after hashing all the blocks, it calculates the cosine similarity on the RGB block with the highest coincidence among hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce complexity, I decided to work with consecutive blocks of ``n``, which it is not ideal, but with small sizes of ``n`` it performs well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I compared both methods, raw cosine and hashing + cosine, here are the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "![exec_times](ex_01/exec_time.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![similarity](ex_01/similarity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the images, the only moment where hashing + cosine is worst is when searching for a single line. In all other cases, it is better in time. In terms of similarity, it is always better. The results suggest that the hashing techniques is better for a wider band search, faster and accurate, in other case, if the search is for a single line, the raw cosine is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is also one example of the similarity between the images:\n",
    "\n",
    "![example_similarity](ex_01/example_similarity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The result shows two consecutive bands of the same image, despite not having the same pattern, the color matches and makes the difference between the comparison among other bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the questions was *which size of the block is ideal in terms of similarity*. It is obvious that as long as the block size increases, the similarity decreases. This is because it is more difficult to find common patterns in larger blocks. However, the time complexity is reduced. The election of ``n`` depends mainly on the size of the image in which we want to perform the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a wider band search, but in this case the coincidence is clear to the human eye despite the low similarity:\n",
